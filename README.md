#Ldglite  [![Build Status][travis-badge]][travis]

**Ldglite** is a program that lets you create, edit, and view Lego brick
models stored in LDRAW format. It was created by connecting the LDLite
DAT file parser to an OpenGL rendering engine and the FreeGLUT toolkit,
making it portable to many operating systems.  It currently runs in
Windows, Linux, MacOS, and BSD unix, and operates in several
compatibility modes. Orignial Soruce by Don Heyse and Lars C Hassing Copyright (c) 2016
